# LoopForge

LoopForge is an AI-powered open-source framework designed to help developers understand, modify, and continuously extend large software projects. Combining machine learning, RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), and code analysis, LoopForge can generate suggestions, optimize code, and make automatic changes to existing projects.

## Vision

LoopForge aims to create a self-improving software development environment where developers retain control while AI assists in tasks such as refactoring, documentation, and test creation efficiently.

## Features

- **Code Analysis**: Through RAG and AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), the code is understood and indexed.
- **Automated Refactoring**: Suggestions for structural and stylistic improvements.
- **Test Generation & Documentation**: Automatically creates tests and detailed code documentation.
- **Smart Collaboration**: AI-powered code reviews and suggestions for improving software architecture.
